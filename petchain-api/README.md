PetChain is a decentralized platform on StarkNet that securely manages pet medical records. Today, health data is often scattered, lost, or stuck in outdated systems—making it hard to track vaccinations, manage treatments, or respond quickly in emergencies.

By making records tamper-proof and universally accessible, PetChain keeps vets and pet owners aligned—no matter where the pet is or who’s treating them. Pets get a scannable tag for quick access to key medical details. This tag can act as a tracker if pet goes missing.
